# Machine Learning From Scratch

## About
Python implementations of the ensemble classifier proposed in:
"Mohamed A. Mahfouz*1, Amin Shoukry 1, 2, Mohamed A. Ismail, 'EKNN: Ensemble Classifier Incorporating Connectivity and Density into kNN with Application to Cancer Diagnosis'
revised in journal of Artificial intellegence in medicine, 2020" 

The purpose of this project is not to produce as optimized and computationally efficient algorithms as possible
but rather to present the inner workings of them in a transparent and accessible way.
